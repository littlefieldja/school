#Notes CS2705

###Notes September 9, 2015
	
		Chapter 2
		
		- make to sides of the world talk to one another 
		
		Point A -> gives note to mail lad -> 3 party translator -> 
		gives note to mail lad -> Point B 
		
		OSI (Internation Standard Operations) 
		
			7 layers 
	
			7 - Application 
			6 - Presentation
			5 - Session
			4 - Transport
			3 - Network
			2 - Data link 
			1 - Physical
			
			All layers only talk to one layer below it. 
			**LOCAL COMMUNTCATION** - talking from A to B.
			
			7 layers become three layers 
			
			3 - User support layers
			2 - transport layer
			1 - network support Layers
			
			data from top to bottom gets Larger getting headers and such
			data from bottome to top gets small losing **HEADERS**
			
			**APPLICATION LAYER** 
				- Enabling application network access 
			**PRESENTATION LAYER**
				- encryption, compression, translation
			**SESSION**
				- Managing the connection/session how talks when  
			**TRANSPORT**
				- process to process talking between the to process
				- We also provide relibale communication
			**NETWORK**
				- host to host talking from one PC to another
				- internetworking occurs here
				- source to destination point A to point B  	
			**DATA LINK**	
				- Node to Node or Hop to Hop Next step in proccess maybe internal
				- organize the bites into frames
			**PHYSICAL**
				- Where the physical implementation on moving bits
				- what are the bits? what pattern doing they follow all answers here!
				
		
		**TCP/IP**
		
			started wtih 4 layers and has progressed to 5 
			
			5 - Application
			4 - Transport 
			3 - Network
			2 - Data Link
			1 - Physical 
			
			**PHYSICAL**
				- bites are created 
			**DATA LINK**
				- frames are created 
				- physical address
			**NETWORK**
				- Packets / datagrams
				- logical (ip address)
			**TRANSPORT** 
				- Packets / user datagrams / segments
				- ports address 
			**APPLICATION**
				- message
				- application specific address
			
			ARP used in but data link and network! 
			
			differnt types of address 
			- unicat (one)
			- muilticast (group)
			- broadcast	(everone) 
			
		Chapter 3	
		
			LANS WANS and MANS
			
			LANS
				- Ethernet, token ring, FDDI
				
			IEEE 
				802.11 Wireless
				802.3  Lan wire 
				
			Ethernet Frame 
				
				Physical 
					Part one
						- preamble (7 bits)
					Part Two
						- SFD (1 byte)
				 	
					Part three 
					 	- destiation Address (6 byte)
					Part four 
						- Source Addressd (6 bytes)
					
					Part five 
						- Type Length (2 byte)
					Part six 
						- Data
					Part seven
						- Check (4 bytes)
						
						
			Endian order (network order)
				big endian - most important byte first 
				little endian - least important byte first
				
				internet uses big endian 
				
				1500 Max size you can send **QUIZ** 
				
			
			ADDRESSES 
				
				mac address 6 bytes long in hex. 	
					a0:b4:32:76:9C:03
				
				second char is 
					0 = unicast 
					1 = multicast 
					a = even 
					b = odd
					
				FF:FF:FF:FF:FF broadcast! 
				
				first ethernet was a 10 mbps 
				eithernet has been update 4 times 
				
				Standard - 10 megs  
				fast - 100 megs
				Gigabyte - 1000 megs 
				10 Gigabyte - 10000 megs 
				
				**STANDARD** 
					- bus/star topology
					- CSMA/CD used to not collission 
						listen before you talk!
				A ------- C
				----------> (time pasted) call probagation time
				| 		    (tranmission time)
				----------> 
				
				longest time transTime = 2X prop.time.
				
				if you know trans **rateXdelay=MinPackageSize**
				
				**FAST**
				upgrade data speed 
				keep everything the same 
				half-duplex(hub)
				full-duplex(star)
				
				----------->
				<----------
				
				half one person can talk at once 
				full both people can talk at once
				
				auto negotiation
				
				**GIGABIT**
				they did the same as upgraded to fast 
				PLUS -
					half must have very small distances 
					or you have to increase size of packet
				TRADITIONAL
					25m calbe must be used 
					carrier extenstion - pad frame if to short! 
					frame bursting -- hold back until you get two or three back
					
				**10 GIGABIT**
					upgrade data rate 
					must be fiber opic calbe 
					keep it compatible 
					throw out half duplex
