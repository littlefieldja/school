###Chapter 2
		
		- make to sides of the world talk to one another 
		
		Point A -> gives note to mail lad -> 3 party translator -> 
		gives note to mail lad -> Point B 
		
		OSI (Internation Standard Operations) 
		
			7 layers 
	
			7 - Application 
			6 - Presentation
			5 - Session
			4 - Transport
			3 - Network
			2 - Data link 
			1 - Physical
			
			All layers only talk to one layer below it. 
			**LOCAL COMMUNTCATION** - talking from A to B.
			
			7 layers become three layers 
			
			3 - User support layers
			2 - transport layer
			1 - network support Layers
			
			data from top to bottom gets Larger getting headers and such
			data from bottome to top gets small losing **HEADERS**
			
			**APPLICATION LAYER** 
				- Enabling application network access 
			**PRESENTATION LAYER**
				- encryption, compression, translation
			**SESSION**
				- Managing the connection/session how talks when  
			**TRANSPORT**
				- process to process talking between the to process
				- We also provide relibale communication
			**NETWORK**
				- host to host talking from one PC to another
				- internetworking occurs here
				- source to destination point A to point B  	
			**DATA LINK**	
				- Node to Node or Hop to Hop Next step in proccess maybe internal
				- organize the bites into frames
			**PHYSICAL**
				- Where the physical implementation on moving bits
				- what are the bits? what pattern doing they follow all answers here!
				
		
		**TCP/IP**
		
			started wtih 4 layers and has progressed to 5 
			
			5 - Application
			4 - Transport 
			3 - Network
			2 - Data Link
			1 - Physical 
			
			**PHYSICAL**
				- bites are created 
			**DATA LINK**
				- frames are created 
				- physical address
			**NETWORK**
				- Packets / datagrams
				- logical (ip address)
			**TRANSPORT** 
				- Packets / user datagrams / segments
				- ports address 
			**APPLICATION**
				- message
				- application specific address
			
			ARP used in but data link and network! 
			
			differnt types of address 
			- unicat (one)
			- muilticast (group)
			- broadcast	(everone) 
			
		Chapter 3	
		
			LANS WANS and MANS
			
			LANS
				- Ethernet, token ring, FDDI
				
			IEEE 
				802.11 Wireless
				802.3  Lan wire 
				
			Ethernet Frame 
				
				Physical 
					Part one
						- preamble (7 bits)
					Part Two
						- SFD (1 byte)
				 	
					Part three 
					 	- destiation Address (6 byte)
					Part four 
						- Source Addressd (6 bytes)
					
					Part five 
						- Type Length (2 byte)
					Part six 
						- Data
					Part seven
						- Check (4 bytes)
						
						
			Endian order (network order)
				big endian - most important byte first 
				little endian - least important byte first
				
				internet uses big endian 
				
				1500 Max size you can send **QUIZ** 
				
			
			ADDRESSES 
				
				mac address 6 bytes long in hex. 	
					a0:b4:32:76:9C:03
				
				second char is 
					0 = unicast 
					1 = multicast 
					a = even 
					b = odd
					
				FF:FF:FF:FF:FF broadcast! 
				
				first ethernet was a 10 mbps 
				eithernet has been update 4 times 
				
				Standard - 10 megs  
				fast - 100 megs
				Gigabyte - 1000 megs 
				10 Gigabyte - 10000 megs 
				
				**STANDARD** 
					- bus/star topology
					- CSMA/CD used to not collission 
						listen before you talk!
				A ------- C
				----------> (time pasted) call probagation time
				| 		    (tranmission time)
				----------> 
				
				longest time transTime = 2X prop.time.
				
				if you know trans **rateXdelay=MinPackageSize**
				
				**FAST**
				upgrade data speed 
				keep everything the same 
				half-duplex(hub)
				full-duplex(star)
				
				----------->
				<----------
				
				half one person can talk at once 
				full both people can talk at once
				
				auto negotiation
				
				**GIGABIT**
				they did the same as upgraded to fast 
				PLUS -
					half must have very small distances 
					or you have to increase size of packet
				TRADITIONAL
					25m calbe must be used 
					carrier extenstion - pad frame if to short! 
					frame bursting -- hold back until you get two or three back
					
				**10 GIGABIT**
					upgrade data rate 
					must be fiber opic calbe 
					keep it compatible 
					throw out half duplex

###Chapter 3
		Bss - basic service set 
		
		Lots of device talking to one and another - AD-HOC 
			Bunch of computers talking wirelessly! 
			
		If you add a AP 
			computer talking to AP - 
			
		ESS extended Service set 
			1 + BSS 
				
				LAN -> ap -> PC 
						  -> PC 
					-> ap -> PC 
						  -> PC 
						  
		Stations 
			No Transtion Station 
				Always stay in the same basic service set
				Wont move around 
			BSS - Transtion Station 
				computer can move from AP to AP with in the same ESS
			ESS - Transtion Station 
				move from one ESS to another ESS! 
				
			RTS 
				- request to send ... message to see if i can send the message to AP
				- in the send we ask HOW LONG WILL IT BE? 
			CTS  						 
				- Clear to send ... send a message back that you are good for 5ms! 
				- B will not send for X time! 
				
		PROBLEMS 
			hidden station problem 
				- occurs when A(PC) is talk to AP and B(PC) is talking to AP 
				  but A CANT SEE B
				  
			Exposed Station 
				- we suck at life so can solve the issue (million dollar question) 
				
		Frame Control - 2 bytes 
			- verson 
			- type 
			- retry flag
			- wep
			- to ds
			- from ds
			Duration/ID - 2bytes 
			
			add .1 - 6bytes 
			
			add .2 - 6 bytes 
			
			add .3 - 6 bytes 
			
		
		BLUETOOTH
			Piconet - maxium of 8 active devices 
			1. must be primary device 
			2+ must be secondary devices 
			
			operatates at 1 mb a second 
			2.4 ghz 
			
		WAN (point to point technology- connect one to one) 
			- 56k modems
			- DSL (one upgrade from previous)
				- A-DSL
					- 0 voice 
					- 1-5 to buffer 
					- 6-30 for upstream 1.4 mbps
					- 31 - 255 downstream 13 mbps 
			- Cable modems 
					- 27 mbps down 
					- 12 mbps up
			- T-Lines
				- t.1 
					- 1.43 mbps 
				- t.3
					- 44 mbps 
			- SONET 
				- 50 mbps - 10 gbps
				
		WAN - switched Network 
			- x.25
			- Frame Relay 
				- some what in use 
			- ATM (asyncroness transmitting Message)
				- connection - oriented 
				- virtual circuits 
				
		Devices 
			Repeater 
				- relays message
			Hub
				- everyone 
			Bridge/layer 2 switch  
				- only sends to one place
				- layer 2 switch is a bridge is a software
			router/layer 3 swtich 
				- works at the network layer 
					- looks at packets 
					- and routing on your IP address
					- changes mac address

		IP ADRESS IPv4 
			They are unique in to differnet ways (one and only one)
				- there is only one ip address 
				- and only one device for ip address 
			Univeral - accepted/reconnized)
				- they are seen by everyone on the network
				- All IP adress have 32 bites and 4 bytes long :)
				- 2^32 = 4.29 BILLION thats how many address we have
			Two-level addressing 
				- Networking (NET ID) 
				- Host 	(HOST_ID)
			*CLASSFUL ADDRESSING*
				5 classes 
					A - 50% all ip address (0...127) binary starts w/ 0      255.0.0.0
					B - 25% all ip address (128 -191) binary starts w/ 10	 255.255.0.0
					C - 12.5% all ip address (192-223) binary starts w/110	 255.255.255.0
					D - 6.25% all ip address (224-239) binary starts w/1110 
					E - 6.25% all ip address (249-255) binary starts w/1111
					
				*NET_ID*
				5 classes 
					A - first byte netid last 3 hostid
						256 Networks 16 bilion host
					b - two bytes netid two bytes host id
						16,000 networks, 65536 bytes
					c - three bytes net id last byte host id
						2 million networks 256 host ids
					d - multicast
					
					e - reserved for future! 	
					
				FIND THE NET ID FOR 
				13.27.101.3
					Class a (lead byte is less then 127)
				   AND ( this is a key ) 
					Mask 255.0.0.0
					
					ANDING  
					13.27.101.3 
					255.0.0.0
				NETWORK ID of IP (13.27.101.3) is 13.0.0.0! 
				
			*CLASSLESSS*
				varaible length block no classes (hints classless)
				uses address aggregation 
					- lets you create a super network.
				number of host must be power of two ( 1,2,4,8,16,32,64...)
				rename netid and hostid to prefix and suffix 
				
				13.27.0.5/12 

###CHAPTER 4
	
		circut switched 
		
		packet switched
			lines are shared connection-oriented 
				approch uses virtual circut
		
		connect less 
			each packey is independent 
			routing is based on dest addr
			delay between each routing decision 
			
		Connection Oriented
			- establish virtual circute all packets will be routed identically 
			- route based on a flow label/circuit ID
			- three phases
				- setup
					- send a request packet (it ask for a connection and assigns flowlabel w/ circuitId)
					- destination then send a response (say yes and lets start)
				- data transfer 
					- then send packet/packages (no issue or delay on routing) 
				- tear down
					- lets everything know its good and end connections!
