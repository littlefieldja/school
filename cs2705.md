		Chapter 2
		
		- make to sides of the world talk to one another 
		
		Point A -> gives note to mail lad -> 3 party translator -> 
		gives note to mail lad -> Point B 
		
		OSI (Internation Standard Operations) 
		
			7 layers 
	
			7 - Application 
			6 - Presentation
			5 - Session
			4 - Transport
			3 - Network
			2 - Data link 
			1 - Physical
			
			All layers only talk to one layer below it. 
			**LOCAL COMMUNTCATION** - talking from A to B.
			
			7 layers become three layers 
			
			3 - User support layers
			2 - transport layer
			1 - network support Layers
			
			data from top to bottom gets Larger getting headers and such
			data from bottome to top gets small losing **HEADERS**
			
			**APPLICATION LAYER** 
				- Enabling application network access 
			**PRESENTATION LAYER**
				- encryption, compression, translation
			**SESSION**
				- Managing the connection/session how talks when  
			**TRANSPORT**
				- process to process talking between the to process
				- We also provide relibale communication
			**NETWORK**
				- host to host talking from one PC to another
				- internetworking occurs here
				- source to destination point A to point B  	
			**DATA LINK**	
				- Node to Node or Hop to Hop Next step in proccess maybe internal
				- organize the bites into frames
			**PHYSICAL**
				- Where the physical implementation on moving bits
				- what are the bits? what pattern doing they follow all answers here!
				
		
		**TCP/IP**
		
		started wtih 4 layers and has progressed to 5 
		
		5 - Application
		4 - Transport
