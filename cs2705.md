###Chapter 2
		
		- make to sides of the world talk to one another 
		
		Point A -> gives note to mail lad -> 3 party translator -> 
		gives note to mail lad -> Point B 
		
		OSI (Internation Standard Operations) 
		
			7 layers 
	
			7 - Application 
			6 - Presentation
			5 - Session
			4 - Transport
			3 - Network
			2 - Data link 
			1 - Physical
			
			All layers only talk to one layer below it. 
			**LOCAL COMMUNTCATION** - talking from A to B.
			
			7 layers become three layers 
			
			3 - User support layers
			2 - transport layer
			1 - network support Layers
			
			data from top to bottom gets Larger getting headers and such
			data from bottome to top gets small losing **HEADERS**
			
			**APPLICATION LAYER** 
				- Enabling application network access 
			**PRESENTATION LAYER**
				- encryption, compression, translation
			**SESSION**
				- Managing the connection/session how talks when  
			**TRANSPORT**
				- process to process talking between the to process
				- We also provide relibale communication
			**NETWORK**
				- host to host talking from one PC to another
				- internetworking occurs here
				- source to destination point A to point B  	
			**DATA LINK**	
				- Node to Node or Hop to Hop Next step in proccess maybe internal
				- organize the bites into frames
			**PHYSICAL**
				- Where the physical implementation on moving bits
				- what are the bits? what pattern doing they follow all answers here!
				
		
		**TCP/IP**
		
			started wtih 4 layers and has progressed to 5 
			
			5 - Application
			4 - Transport 
			3 - Network
			2 - Data Link
			1 - Physical 
			
			**PHYSICAL**
				- bites are created 
			**DATA LINK**
				- frames are created 
				- physical address
			**NETWORK**
				- Packets / datagrams
				- logical (ip address)
			**TRANSPORT** 
				- Packets / user datagrams / segments
				- ports address 
			**APPLICATION**
				- message
				- application specific address
			
			ARP used in but data link and network! 
			
			differnt types of address 
			- unicat (one)
			- muilticast (group)
			- broadcast	(everone) 
			
		Chapter 3	
		
			LANS WANS and MANS
			
			LANS
				- Ethernet, token ring, FDDI
				
			IEEE 
				802.11 Wireless
				802.3  Lan wire 
				
			Ethernet Frame 
				
				Physical 
					Part one
						- preamble (7 bits)
					Part Two
						- SFD (1 byte)
				 	
					Part three 
					 	- destiation Address (6 byte)
					Part four 
						- Source Addressd (6 bytes)
					
					Part five 
						- Type Length (2 byte)
					Part six 
						- Data
					Part seven
						- Check (4 bytes)
						
						
			Endian order (network order)
				big endian - most important byte first 
				little endian - least important byte first
				
				internet uses big endian 
				
				1500 Max size you can send **QUIZ** 
				
			
			ADDRESSES 
				
				mac address 6 bytes long in hex. 	
					a0:b4:32:76:9C:03
				
				second char is 
					0 = unicast 
					1 = multicast 
					a = even 
					b = odd
					
				FF:FF:FF:FF:FF broadcast! 
				
				first ethernet was a 10 mbps 
				eithernet has been update 4 times 
				
				Standard - 10 megs  
				fast - 100 megs
				Gigabyte - 1000 megs 
				10 Gigabyte - 10000 megs 
				
				**STANDARD** 
					- bus/star topology
					- CSMA/CD used to not collission 
						listen before you talk!
				A ------- C
				----------> (time pasted) call probagation time
				| 		    (tranmission time)
				----------> 
				
				longest time transTime = 2X prop.time.
				
				if you know trans **rateXdelay=MinPackageSize**
				
				**FAST**
				upgrade data speed 
				keep everything the same 
				half-duplex(hub)
				full-duplex(star)
				
				----------->
				<----------
				
				half one person can talk at once 
				full both people can talk at once
				
				auto negotiation
				
				**GIGABIT**
				they did the same as upgraded to fast 
				PLUS -
					half must have very small distances 
					or you have to increase size of packet
				TRADITIONAL
					25m calbe must be used 
					carrier extenstion - pad frame if to short! 
					frame bursting -- hold back until you get two or three back
					
				**10 GIGABIT**
					upgrade data rate 
					must be fiber opic calbe 
					keep it compatible 
					throw out half duplex

###Chapter 3
		Bss - basic service set 
		
		Lots of device talking to one and another - AD-HOC 
			Bunch of computers talking wirelessly! 
			
		If you add a AP 
			computer talking to AP - 
			
		ESS extended Service set 
			1 + BSS 
				
				LAN -> ap -> PC 
						  -> PC 
					-> ap -> PC 
						  -> PC 
						  
		Stations 
			No Transtion Station 
				Always stay in the same basic service set
				Wont move around 
			BSS - Transtion Station 
				computer can move from AP to AP with in the same ESS
			ESS - Transtion Station 
				move from one ESS to another ESS! 
				
			RTS 
				- request to send ... message to see if i can send the message to AP
				- in the send we ask HOW LONG WILL IT BE? 
			CTS  						 
				- Clear to send ... send a message back that you are good for 5ms! 
				- B will not send for X time! 
				
		PROBLEMS 
			hidden station problem 
				- occurs when A(PC) is talk to AP and B(PC) is talking to AP 
				  but A CANT SEE B
				  
			Exposed Station 
				- we suck at life so can solve the issue (million dollar question) 
				
		Frame Control - 2 bytes 
			- verson 
			- type 
			- retry flag
			- wep
			- to ds
			- from ds
			Duration/ID - 2bytes 
			
			add .1 - 6bytes 
			
			add .2 - 6 bytes 
			
			add .3 - 6 bytes 
			
		
		BLUETOOTH
			Piconet - maxium of 8 active devices 
			1. must be primary device 
			2+ must be secondary devices 
			
			operatates at 1 mb a second 
			2.4 ghz 
			
		WAN (point to point technology- connect one to one) 
			- 56k modems
			- DSL (one upgrade from previous)
				- A-DSL
					- 0 voice 
					- 1-5 to buffer 
					- 6-30 for upstream 1.4 mbps
					- 31 - 255 downstream 13 mbps 
			- Cable modems 
					- 27 mbps down 
					- 12 mbps up
			- T-Lines
				- t.1 
					- 1.43 mbps 
				- t.3
					- 44 mbps 
			- SONET 
				- 50 mbps - 10 gbps
				
		WAN - switched Network 
			- x.25
			- Frame Relay 
				- some what in use 
			- ATM (asyncroness transmitting Message)
				- connection - oriented 
				- virtual circuits 
				
		Devices 
			Repeater 
				- relays message
			Hub
				- everyone 
			Bridge/layer 2 switch  
				- only sends to one place
				- layer 2 switch is a bridge is a software
			router/layer 3 swtich 
				- works at the network layer 
					- looks at packets 
					- and routing on your IP address
					- changes mac address

		IP ADRESS IPv4 
			They are unique in to differnet ways (one and only one)
				- there is only one ip address 
				- and only one device for ip address 
			Univeral - accepted/reconnized)
				- they are seen by everyone on the network
				- All IP adress have 32 bites and 4 bytes long :)
				- 2^32 = 4.29 BILLION thats how many address we have
			Two-level addressing 
				- Networking (NET ID) 
				- Host 	(HOST_ID)
			*CLASSFUL ADDRESSING*
				5 classes 
					A - 50% all ip address (0...127) binary starts w/ 0      255.0.0.0
					B - 25% all ip address (128 -191) binary starts w/ 10	 255.255.0.0
					C - 12.5% all ip address (192-223) binary starts w/110	 255.255.255.0
					D - 6.25% all ip address (224-239) binary starts w/1110 
					E - 6.25% all ip address (249-255) binary starts w/1111
					
				*NET_ID*
				5 classes 
					A - first byte netid last 3 hostid
						256 Networks 16 bilion host
					b - two bytes netid two bytes host id
						16,000 networks, 65536 bytes
					c - three bytes net id last byte host id
						2 million networks 256 host ids
					d - multicast
					
					e - reserved for future! 	
					
				FIND THE NET ID FOR 
				13.27.101.3
					Class a (lead byte is less then 127)
				   AND ( this is a key ) 
					Mask 255.0.0.0
					
					ANDING  
					13.27.101.3 
					255.0.0.0
				NETWORK ID of IP (13.27.101.3) is 13.0.0.0! 
				
			*CLASSLESSS*
				varaible length block no classes (hints classless)
				uses address aggregation 
					- lets you create a super network.
				number of host must be power of two ( 1,2,4,8,16,32,64...)
				rename netid and hostid to prefix and suffix 
				
				13.27.0.5/12 

###CHAPTER 4
	
		circut switched 
		
		packet switched
			lines are shared connection-oriented 
				approch uses virtual circut
		
		connect less 
			each packey is independent 
			routing is based on dest addr
			delay between each routing decision 
			
		Connection Oriented
			- establish virtual circute all packets will be routed identically 
			- route based on a flow label/circuit ID
			- three phases
				- setup
					- send a request packet (it ask for a connection and assigns flowlabel w/ circuitId)
					- destination then send a response (say yes and lets start)
				- data transfer 
					- then send packet/packages (no issue or delay on routing) 
				- tear down
					- lets everything know its good and end connections! 
					

##Notes September 21, 2015	
_____________________________________		
		
		Specail Address 
			0.0.0.0 (this network) 
				- you can use this when there is no true network 
			255.255.255.255
				- local braodcast use if you wanna talk to everyone
				- doesnt go past the router!
			127.0.0.0/8 
				- this is the loop back address 
				- anything that starts with 127
				- most common is 127.0.0.1 (local host)
			10.0.0.0/8	
				- this is an internal and includs other ip address
				- 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/19
				
		Network Address
			prefix follwed by 0's
			
			prefix followed by 1's. 
		
	
		Common Question for bull shit 
		
		when do we start? 
		when do we end? 
		how many? 
		
		with IP 10.0.5.10
			- this is class A
			start - AND the network mask 
			
			end - complement (switch ones to zeros and zeros to ones) OR 
			
			
			AND 
				255.0.0.0
				10 .0.5.10
				_________ pick the smaller
				10.0.0.0  
			
			Classless 
				173.96.24.19 / 22
				255.255.252.0
				
				when does it start? 
				when does it end? 
				how many are there? 
				
				start(pick the smaller binary)
				AND THEM 
				
				173.96.25.16
				255.255.252.0
				-------------
				173.96.24.0
				
				END (flip and or (pick the greater binary))
				
				173.69.25.16
				0  .0 .0 .255
				--------------
				173.69.27.255
				
				HOW MANY 2^(32-n)
				
				in this case 2^32-22
				2^10 1024
				
###Chapter 6 

		delivery (lower layers)
			- direct - You are done when you match same network address (ARP) - Map IP to MAC
			- Indirect - next router/hop - next hop lookup (router table)
				- destIP -> Routing table -> Next HopIP (ARP) -> MAC
		forwared (layer 3) - delivery to next station 
		
		
##Notes September 23, 2015	
_____________________________________	
			
		FORWARDING 
			connectionless 
				-> based on destination IP address
			Connection Oriented 
				-> Flow Label 
				
			Storing the full right is not a good bite 
			
			Full Route - gets and hold the full route
			
			next hop or hopr by hop 
			
			newtwrok specific- talk to shit 
			
			default 
			
			makes the munt some!
			
			CLASS FULL
				divide router table in to lots of many routing tables 
				A: Network Address, Next hop Address, interface 
				B, C
				
		CLASS LESS
			
				DO SOMETHING 
				create a routing table 
				
				Class A adresses
				Netowrk Address || Destination address || Interface					
				111.0.0.0		|| ... (R1 is conn)	   || M0
				
				Class B address
				Netowrk Address || Destination address || Interface					
				170.14.0.0		|| .... (r1 is conn)   || M2	
				145.80.0.0		|| .... (R1 is conn)   || M1
				
				Class C address 
				Netowrk Address || Destination address || Interface
				192.26.7.0		|| 111.15.17.32		   || m1
				
				DEFAULT  	
				Netowrk Address || Destination address || Interface		
				random ass IP 	|| 111.30.31.18		   || Interface
				
		CLASSFUL
				R1 
				Mask	|| Net Address	|| Next hop	|| Interface
				/26		|| 180.70.65.192|| ....		|| m2
				/25		|| 180.70.65.128|| ... 		|| m0
				/24 	|| 201.4.22.0  	|| ... 		|| m3
				/22		|| 201.4.19.0	|| ...		|| m1 
				defalt 	|| default 		|| 180.70.65.200

		FRAGMENTATION
			Identifaction
				- identifies the fragment
			frag. offset
				 - is starting bite of fragment
			flags 
				- 3 bytes but only use 2 one no flag the other more flag
			
		MTU 
			- maximum transfer unit is the most you can send!
				EXAMPLE 
					- Ethernet handles 1500 max
					- PPP does 296 max
					- FDDI does 4352 max 
				if you send from ethernet to PPP you would have to do fragmentation 
				you only reassymble fragments at the destanation! 
				
				only fragment Data 
					header is just copied 
					
				flag more would be 0 if there are more or zero left
				flag not set is 1
				if flag offset is 0 then it is the first piece and if there are no other fragments then it is not fragmented 
				
				middle fragment 
					offset > 0
					more = 1
						
				first fragment 
				offset > 0 
				more = 0
				
				last 
				offset = 0 
				more = 0
				
			OPTIONS 0-40 bytes 
				Not cool
					EOO - end of optionw - 00000000 
					NOP - no operation.. doesnt do anything 00000001 
				Cool
					record keeping 
						- use to help understand the network 
						RECORD ROUTE 
							- 00000011 - then lenght then pointer 
							- can record upto 9 
							- if space runs out ... stop recording 
						STRICT SOURCE ROUTING 
							- 10001001 
							- swaps the destination address has it travels 
						LOOSE SOURCE ROUTING 
							- 10000011
							- alot link strict source 
							- has a lenght a pointer and list ... PLUS it looks at the list and makes sure it hit every router in the list and extras if need be 
						TIME STAMP OPTION 
							- 01000011
							- need extra information
							- lenght and pointer 
							- also has overflow and flags 
								if flags are 0 then only record timestap (how long it takes to move through the network)
								if flags are 1 then record both IP and timestamp 
								if flags are 3 then tell IP and record timestamp 
								
							unlike record and loose where you can only hold 9 IP 
							in timestamp you have overflow that tells you what you couldnt record 
							
							
						COMMANDS 
							- To record route 
								ping -R www.google.com
									Some times they dont work because of security issues 
							- to record hopes you can set to 2 
								ping -t 2 www.google.com
									will time out at time to live exceeded 
									
							- traceroute 
								traceroute www.google.com
									response with *** until it works 
									
			RULES 
				- Number of adresses are in the power of 2
				- prefix lenght 32 - logbase2 ^ (n)
				- countiguous block 
				- starting at location devisble by (n) allocate the largest block first
